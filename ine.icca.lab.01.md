Click on `S3` will show you all the options for `S3` buckets and in same manner you can see the options for `Athena`.

## Provision AWS resources

For this requirement, you will provision two resources - an EC2 instance and a S3 bucket. The EC2 instance is a virtual machine that you can run compute workloads on. The S3 bucket is a cloud storage space. You will primarily use standard options for each - the goal is to become familiar with the process of provisioning resources, not these two resources in particular.

Go to all the services and click on `EC2`.
